In addition to the code found in the directories driver, server, and
aes, you will also find a makefile that can be used to complile and
run the application.

First, build the application by running:
	make build

Next, you can run a test user instance by running:
	make testuser1

Two additional users can be simulated by running:
	make testuser2
	or
	make testuser3

Messages are formatted as follows:
	first 9 letters are for destination address (ex, localhost)
	next 4 are for the destination port
	next 10 are for your identifier
	remaining letters are the message

The following are some examples of input:
	localhost7891client 1  hi there
	localhost7892benjaminb hello this is a message
	localhost7893identifierhello there

Class files can be cleaned up by running:
	make clean
